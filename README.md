## a timed test of all the possible unique multiplication questions between 1 and 10

I wanted a way to motivate my daughter to memorize the multiplication table from 1 to 10 and I didn't want to mark it every time. Or time it. So, I created this program up. It populates a list with all the unique multiplication combinations between 1 and 10 and then prompts the user for each of them in a random way. It also times the user. All possible questions must be answered within 5 minutes. It computes the score as well.
